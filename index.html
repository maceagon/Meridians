          As a child, the musician MacEagon Voyce had a debilitating stammer. He
          was a hopeless bearer of his own last name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Singing was the only way to cheat it, but even then, he was bullied
          and forced to turn inwards. In time, he lost trust in his voice, and a
          rift emerged between himself and a self-image he named "Moon Man."
        </p>
        <p>
          In his journey, he realised that everyone has a Moon Man. Each of us
          has a “meridian,” that liminal space between the “true self” and the
          image we project to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          And through his music, he realised he could invite people to join the
          healing process. Because when we trust and express more of our full
          selves together, we add more authentic, diverse expression to the
          world, and we become more receptive to ways of being that are not
          familiar to us.

          Today, Meridians is that gathering. It's a pioneering performance
          framework that combines guided reflection, live music, and immersive
          technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          As MacEagon performs in <em>Meridians</em> shows, guided by authentic
          relating specialist Dr. Adriana Candeias, the audience is invited to
          reflect on moments they, too, have struggled to embody their true
          voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants explore their hidden selves through written and drawn
          reflections, which are collated and transformed into a collective
          character that inhabits the <em>Braneworld</em>, a persisting virtual
          realm where these characters live on after the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          These characteers are abiding representations of our shared moments of
          expression -- individual struggles transformed into collective
          strength.

        <h3>The Portugal Pilot</h3>
        <p>
          At a Portugal festival, 60 participants reflected on their meridians
          while MacEagon performed, and their written/drawn responses were later
          transformed into "Voz," the first collective Braneworld character. The
          audience then named Voz and helped build their backstory. This proved
          a core concept: people want to be co-creators, not just consumers.

          We expanded the framework with Dr. Adriana Candeias at Made by Many in

        <h3>MacEagon Voyce</h3>
        <p>
          MacEagon studied vocal performance and composition at Carleton
          College, singing through his stammer while finding solace in the
          written word, writing as a journalist at the intersection of art and
          technology (Vice, Nerdist).
        </p>
        <p>
          For years he hid behind his pen, until he found (<a
            href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/alvin-lucier-has-found-the-music-in-the-world-around-him-for-more-than-50-years/"
            target="_blank"
            >and later interviewed</a
          >) the stammering composer Alvin Lucier – a technological pioneer and
          premier name of the 20th-century avant-garde.
        </p>
        <p>
          That conversation began a slow, painful relationship with Moon Man.
          Eventually, MacEagon rediscovered his own voice and music. Today the
          singer-songwriter and powerful vocalist performs around the world,
          inviting audiences to explore their meridians and reclaim their
          voices.

          A certified meditation teacher and technologist, MacEagon is also
          dedicated to building more equitable tools for creators. He's
          co-founded Grey Matter and FOLK, and he's hard at work on the
          Meridians album and Braneworld series script, which evolves with the
          birth of each new Meridians character.
